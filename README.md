# FunnyQT Solution of the TTC 2013 Class Diagram Restructuring Case

This is the [FunnyQT](https://github.com/jgralab/funnyqt) Solution to the
*Class Diagram Restructuring* case of the
[TTC 2013](http://planet-sl.org/ttc2013).

The source code file `src/ttc_2013_cd_restruct/core.clj` contains the core and
extension transformations.  The source code file
`test/ttc_2013_cd_restruct/core_test.clj` contains test cases, that is,
invocations of the transformations on the provided test cases plus some
constraints validating the transformation results.

Have a look at the [solution description](https://github.com/tsdh/ttc-2013-cd-restruct/blob/master/desc/ttc13-funnyqt-cd-restruct.pdf?raw=true).
